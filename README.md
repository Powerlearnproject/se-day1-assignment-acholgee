Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of engineeering that is associated with the development a software product using well defined scientific methods and procedures that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.
It is the backbone of modern world i the sense that it creates solutions for global challenges and to secure various systems in the finance industry including a variety of applications used for etertainmet.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages in the 1940s made it easy to write instructions that are more human readable and such languages include C
Establishment of software engineering as a discpline in the 1960s
Advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Analysis, after an idea has been thought and required have been gathered, they are analysed to come up with an approved desired look.
Design, the analysed data is designed and a detailed look is presented.
Implimentation, the design is coded at this stage.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases that are flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach based on the flexibility and collaboration and response to changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes code and impliments them.
A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by testing it.
project manager oversees planning and execution of a software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development enviroment are used for writing testing and debugging code and an example is vs code.
version control systems track changes to source code and example is git.
Testing frameworks are used for testing the process and ensuring software quality and an example is Jest.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, one can adapt to use agile methodology for  an enviromennt where requirements keep changing as it is best suited for that.
Tight deadlines, this can be overcome by coming up with a schedule where you allocate more time to stages that require more work
Technical debt, this ca be solved by involving everyone in coming up with optimal solutions before kicking the project.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves dividing the software into components or modules and testing each module of software separately.
Integration testing is where oe tests the interaction between the system and different components
System testing involves testing the software as a whole.
Acceptance testing is where software is teted against user requirements to ensure that the requirements have been met

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is giving instructions to an AI model to get a response.
It is important in the sense that, it helps improve interaction between humans and AI 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
when will it rain today? and What is the weather forecast today? the first one is vague and the response may be confined to just one element of the weather, while the second one gives you a detailed view of how the whole day is going to be, thhere for giving you more information to help you prepare for the day.
